# motrpacWAT

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

A collection of functions for the analysis and visualization of the MoTrPAC PASS1B white adipose tissue (WAT) data as provided in the <a href="https://motrpac.github.io/MotrpacRatTraining6moData/index.html">`MotrpacRatTraining6moData`</a> package. This package was built specifically to generate the `motrpacWATData` package, so much of it is tailored only for use with those datasets, though users may find some of the functionality contained herein to be useful in other projects:

* Differential analysis (DA) with the <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html">`limma`</a> and <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html">`edgeR`</a> packages
* Volcano plots
* Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (FGSEA) with <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/fgsea.html">`fgsea`</a> and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/msigdbr/index.html">`msigdbr`</a>
* Kinase-Substrate Enrichment Analysis (KSEA) with <a href="https://www.phosphosite.org/homeAction.action">PhosphoSitePlus</a>
* Over-representation analysis (ORA)
* Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA)
